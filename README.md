# HackNC 2020 - Mundia

This is Mundia: Building Friendships without a Barrier. Mundia looks to connect people from all around the world by taking away the language barrier using Google Translate API.

*Note: Still somewhat incomplete.

If you wish to run the server locally (we haven't uploaded it to cloud yet), run the command "node mundia.js" in your terminal after downloading anything you don't have out of this repo, node.js, npm, and all the packages we used, listed below:

mongodb, body-parser, express, path, child-process
